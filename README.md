A python module for the synthetic control method that provides implementations of:

- Synthetic Control Method (Abadie & Gardeazabal 2003)
- Robust Synthetic Control Method (Amjad, Shah & Shen 2018)
- Augmented Synthetic Control Method (Ben-Michael, Feller & Rothstein 2021)
- Penalized Synthetic Control Method (Abadie & L'Hour 2021)

The package also provides methods for performing placebo tests and generating confidence intervals.

The implementation of the synthetic control method aims to be reconcilable with the R package [Synth](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Synth) and similarly the implementation of the Augmented synthetic control method and the R package [augsynth](https://github.com/ebenmichael/augsynth).

## Installation
Install it from PyPI using pip:

````bash
python -m pip install pysyncon
````
